ejectALL
=========

With this Applescript you can eject all of your external media under Mac OS X.


Installation
------------

Save the script to your default scripts folder or other folder. Open the file with Script Editor.app.
I suggest save the script as "Application", so you can execute it directly from Spotlight (like Alfred does).
